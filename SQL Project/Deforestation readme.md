Deforestation Data Analysis Project
Project Overview

The Deforestation Data Analysis project involves analyzing deforestation data using SQL to uncover insights related to various problem statements.
The analysis focuses on understanding the extent of deforestation, income group distributions, and regional patterns.

Problem Statements

Total Number of Countries Involved in Deforestation: Determine the number of countries that have experienced deforestation.
Income Groups with Specific Land Area: Show the income groups of countries having a total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 square meters.
Average Area by Income Group: Calculate the average area in square miles for countries in the 'upper middle income' region and compare it with other income categories.
Forest Area by Income Group: Determine the total forest area in square kilometers for countries in the 'high income' group and compare it with other income categories.
Top Forest Areas by Region: Show countries from each region (continent) with the highest total forest areas.
